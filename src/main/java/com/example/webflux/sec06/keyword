** NOTE **
-   "subscribeOn, publishOn" xử lý bất đồng bộ kiểu:
    All the operations are always executed in sequential



-   .parallel() parallel for CPU tasks, not mean parallel execution
    ParallelFlux doesnt have publishOn, subscribeOn
    multiple publisher (ParallelFlux) downstream -> sequential() convert to single publisher (Flux)
